**Portfolio Analysis Overview**

Portfolio analysis is a key area of investment management that enables market participants to evaluate and assess the performance and risks of a portfolio across various asset classes like equities, fixed income, and alternative investments. The main goals of portfolio analysis are to measure absolute and relative returns, and to ensure the portfolio aligns with the investor's risk tolerance and objectives. 

**Steps for Conducting Portfolio Analysis**

1. Align investor goals with market conditions. Before analyzing a portfolio, it is crucial to ensure the investor's return expectations and risk appetite match the characteristics and outlook of the relevant markets. This alignment sets the overall direction for the portfolio.

2. Develop an asset allocation and implementation strategy. This process blends science and art. It involves defining the asset classes in the portfolio, metrics to analyze performance, benchmark indices for comparison, and the frequency of reviews. The strategy should outline a plan to construct a portfolio per the investor's goals.

3. Evaluate performance and adjust as needed. After a set period, assess if the portfolio achieved the targeted results and make any necessary changes. Also factor in any shifts in the investor's objectives to keep the analysis current.

**Portfolio Analysis Theory**

The saying "don't put all your eggs in one basket" underpins the correlation theory behind portfolio analysis. Investing in securities that move in lockstep could lead to portfolio losses in adverse conditions. However, low correlation means parts of the portfolio may hold up when others decline.

Spreading investments across diverse economic sectors epitomizes this non-correlated approach. If one security slumps due to an event (e.g. airline stocks during COVID-19), another unrelated asset may be resilient (such as 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds). The portfolio value remains stable overall. 

This optimization reduces risk while maximizing returns. But merely selecting sound securities is insufficient for robust portfolio analysis. The appropriate mix of assets is equally vital.

However, this diversification strategy has limitations. During the 2008-2009 Financial Crisis, most assets became correlated and declined in value - stocks, bonds, mutual funds, commodities, real estate, etc.

Nevertheless, reducing correlation across a portfolio is still considered the most effective tactic to improve outcomes and mitigate risk.
